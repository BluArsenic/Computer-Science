# Moves the "turtle" forward by a specified distance in the direction it's facing. You can use either method.
# In this example, the turtle moves forward 100 steps
distance = 100

# Moves the "turtle" backward by a distance in the opposite direction that it's facing. You ca use any of the following methods.
# In this example, the turtle moves backward 100 steps
turtle.backward(distance)

angle = 90

# This example had the turtle turing 90 degrees to the right

# Moves the turtle to a different position; if the "pen" is down, it draws a line.
# Accepts x and y coords., but you can use a pair of numbers for your x coord. and have it accept nthing for your y coord.
# You can use any of these methods

angle = 180

# Draws a circle with a given radius, and an optionally given extent and steps
# The center of the circle is left of turtle
# The extent of the circle is how far you want to draw the circle; the accepted number is i degrees
# The number of steps it takes for the circle to be drawn is equivalent to how many sides the shape has (or how many "strokes" it takes to draw), so this can be used to draw regular polygons
# If the given radius is positive, it will draw the circle or arc counterclockwise; otherwise it will draw it clockwise
# The direction of the circle to change by the extent of the drawn circle
# In this example, a circle with a radius of 50 is being draw in 5 steps; this draws a regular pentagon
# The definition of a regular polygon is a polygon with 'n' sides where each angle and side is the same measurement

# Draws a circular dat with a specified diameter using a specified color
# If the size is not given, the maximum of pensize+4 and 2*pensize is used (pensize default is 1)
# The diameter has to be greater than or equal to 1
# The color can be a string or a numeric color tuple

# Stamps a copy of the turtle's shape onto the picutre/canvas as the turtle's current position
# It returns a stamp ID for that specific stamp, which can be used to delete it

# Deletes all turtle stamps
# If there is no parameter (a number), then it deletes all stamps
# If there is a positive parameter, it deletes the first 'n' stamps
# If there is a negative parameter, it deltes the last 'n' stamps

# Undoes the the turtle's last action
turtle.undo()

# Set's the turtle's speed between 0 and 10
# If the speed is 0, then there is no drawing animation
# If the inputed speed is greater than 10 or less than .5, then speed is set to 0
# If there is no inputed speed, then it returns the current speed value
# You can also use speed strings: fastest = 0, fast = 10, normal = 6, slow = 3, slowest = 1

# ------------------------------------------

#The Turtle's Postions

# Returns the current location of the turtle as coordinates.
# Either moethod works
turtle.position()
turtle.pos()

# Returns the angle of line between the turtle's postion and the position specified by coordinates of another turtle
# You can either use an x and y value, or your x value can be a pair of coordinates
turtle.towards(0,0)

# Returns the turtle's x coord.
turtle.xcor()

# Returns the turtle's y coord.
turtle.ycor()

# Returns the turtle's current orientation or heading
turtle.heading()

# Returns the distance from the turtle to a given coordinate or other turtle
# You can either give an x and y value, or your x value can be a pair of coordinates
turtle.distance(50,50)

# --------------------------------------

#Measurement

# Set angle measurement units (set numbr of "degree" for a full circle)
# Default value is 360 degrees
turtle.degrees(360)

# Set the angle measurement units to radians
# Radians are equivalent to degrees(2*math.pi)
turtle.radians()

#Drawing State

# Pulls the pen up (no drawing when the turtle moves)
turtle.penup()
turtle.pu()
turtle.up()

# Puts the pen down (draws when the turtle moves)
# You can use any of these methods
turtle.pendown()
turtle.pd()
turtle.down()

# Returns the pen's attributes in a dictionary
# Tells you pen color, whether the pen is down or up, pensize, speed, etc.
# The dictionary can be used as the pen argument, where pen is a dictionary
# The pendict parameter is one of more of the keyword arguments that are in the list
penstate = turtle.pen()
turtle.pen(penstate, fillcolor = "yellow")

# Returns True is the pen is down and False if it's up
turtle.isdown()

# -----------------------------------------------

#Color

# Returns or sets the pen color
# Can accept a colorstring (includes hex codes in the form of strings)
# Can accept and RGB value in the form of a tuple or individual numbers

# Accepts the same arguments and pencolor
turtle.color()

turtle.color((255,0,0),(0,255,0)) #sets pen color first, then fill color second

# ------------------------------------------

#Fill

# Returns the fill state (True if ther is fillig, False if not)
turtle.filling()

# Is called before drawing a shape that is going to be filled
turtle.begin_fill()

# Fills the shape rawn after the last begin_fill call
